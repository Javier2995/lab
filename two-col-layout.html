                <h2>First Generation Computers</h2>

                <p>
                    First generation computers bore little resemblance to computers of today,
                    either in appearance or performance. The first generation of computers 
                    took place from 1940 to 1956 and was extremely large in size. The inner 
                    workings of the computers at that time were unsophisticated. 
                    These early machines required magnetic drums for memory and vacuum tubes 
                    that worked as switches and amplifiers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the vacuum tubes that were mainly responsible for the large size 
                    of the machines and the massive amounts of heat that they released. 
                    These computers produced so much heat that they regularly overheated 
                    despite large cooling units. First generation computers also used a very
                    basic programming language that is referred to as machine language.
                </p>

                <h2>Second Generation Computers</h2>
                <p>
                    The second generation (from 1956 to 1963) of computers managed to do away
                    with vacuum tubes in lieu of transistors.This allowed them to use less electricity 
                    and generate less heat.Second generation computers were also significantly faster 
                    than their predecessors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another significant change was in the size of the computers, which were smaller. 
                    Transistor computers also developed core memory which they used alongside magnetic storage.
